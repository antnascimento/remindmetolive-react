        <StoryIntro>
         When I close my eyes and visualize our time in Italy, I see everything in slow-motion. It's definitely a place that I am in love with. Falling in love with a place it's a unique feeling, it is a constant desire for more, more of the beautiful skylines, sunrises, sunsets, delicious food, different culture and new adventures. And the more you take in, the deeper you fall and the more you wish to see. It all started with Rome, continued with Venice, then mesmarizing Tuscany. Now it is time for Pisa, a small and enchanting city in Tuscany.

          Yes, the Leaning Tower is spectacular — even more so in person than in pictures and has made Pisa famous all over the world, but there’s much more to Pisa than that. The medieval city boasts of 11th century gorgeous art, like the elaborate Baptistery and other beautiful palaces. Most of them are in the famous Square of Miracles (Piazza dei Miracoli). The square is surrounded by a beautiful green lawn where tourists lie down and relax admiring the amazing setting.
